TODO

Features desired for a ClojureCast 1.0 Release

Major Goals
- Hide ALL hazelcast specifics from users of CC except for advanced cases
- Distributed computation API for various forms of HZ executors
- Transactions

Minor Goals
- Simple session store model for ring/aleph users
- More support for content-based partitioning for locality
- Cluster lifecycle events as subscribable stream (e.g. for logging / debugging / notification)

Future Issues
- Support for traffic shaping on incoming requests
- Distributed query
- Support for the hazelcast simulator (?)
