;;
;; Clojurecast Scheduler v0.2
;;
;; The cluster maintains a distributed map of jobs (job-id ->
;; job-state). Job state should be a clojure map that contains only
;; serializable values.
;;
;; Each cluster member is assigned a subset of values in the map by
;; the HazelCast partitioner.  When values are added to the map, they
;; are 'scheduled' which includes being setup to listen to job topic
;; events and are immediately passed to a core.async go process, the
;; "run loop".  When they are removed from the map, they are unscheduled
;; and their associated state and run loop is cleaned up.
;;
;; The run loop will call the scheduler/run method with an initial
;; state and registered a control handler for updating the scheduler
;; run loop.
;;
;; Jobs that receive events via the job topic bus have a message
;; handler after which a :resume input is sent to the control loop.
;;
;; Scheduler Subsystem Terminology:
;; - Distributed Job Map (each member owns subset of entries according to partitioning strategy)
;; - Run Loop - a core.async go-loop that executes the workflow
;; - Controller ('ctrl') - a control channel that is used to manage the run loop
;; - LocalEntryListener
;;   - Called when member when owned key-value pairs are added/removed
;;   - Registers a listener to the job's topic
;;   - Starts the local core.async loop
;; - MigrationListener
;;   - Called when partitions are being migrated
;;   - Used to shut down old job controller and listener (if source is still up)
;;   - Creates new listeners and controller on new job when completed
;; - Scheduler
;;   - Contains local entry listener ID and the set of local controllers

;; Default behavior for run and handle-message
;;
;;
;; Special job states:
;; - :job.state/init - A state to enter the first time a job is run,
;;                     default is to proceed directly to :job.state/running
;; - :job.state/reinit - Jobs can implement this to reset state after a migration
;;                       or restart.  The previous state is in :job/prior-state.
;;                       Default is to proceed to :job.state/running
;; - :job.state/running - All jobs implement this as the main entry point
;; - :job.state/failed - The job crashed, storage and ctrl retained but not timeout
;;                       If you override, you can force a reset on an internal failure
;;                       to recover, or notify the admin of an error.  Job state is:
;;                       - :job/error - the error encountered
;;                       - :job/prior-state - the state the job was in when crashing if run
;;                       - :job/msg - the message passed if handle-message
;;                       with the prior tstate
;; - :job.state/paused - The job is paused, storage and ctrl retianed but no timeout
;; - :job.state/terminated - Moving to this state unschedules the job and reclaims
;;                           storage and state.
